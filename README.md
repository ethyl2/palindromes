# Palindrome Checker

----------------------------------------

This site uses a JavaScript function to check to see whether a user's input is
a palindrome -- that is, whether it would read the same backwards and forwards.

Part of the function formats the input to eliminate spaces, punctuation and
capitalization so that those attributes of the input are ignored in determining
whether the input is a palindrome.

The input is displayed in a
[HTML5 canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
to illustrate its two halves.
